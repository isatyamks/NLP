      "neon retreat ho ho ho we re around to that most wonderful time of the year neon leaders retreat time i know that this time of year is extremely hectic and that it s tough to think about anything past the holidays but life does go on past the week of december through january and that s what i d like you to think about for a minute on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week we re going to change the date to the following weekend january now comes the part you need to think about i think we all agree that it s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids etc so brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend and then you can let me know which you prefer the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ve done the past several years this year we could go to the heartland country inn www com outside of brenham it s a nice place where we d have a bedroom and a bedroom house side by side it s in the country real relaxing but also close to brenham and only about one hour and minutes from here we can golf shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham eat dinner together at the ranch and spend time with each other we d meet on saturday and then return on sunday morning just like what we ve done in the past the second option would be to stay here in houston have dinner together at a nice restaurant and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening this might be easier but the trade off would be that we wouldn t have as much time together i ll let you decide email me back with what would be your preference and of course if you re available on that weekend the democratic process will prevail majority vote will rule let me hear from you as soon as possible preferably by the end of the weekend and if the vote doesn t go your way no complaining allowed like i tend to do have a great weekend great golf great fishing great shopping or whatever makes you happy bobby\n",

is an energy deveioper in canada s most highiy coveted reservoirs aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oi and gas again this morning montana oil and gas inc mogi news announces that the syivan lake oil and gas project is sti awaiting a rig at this time the surface lease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest the company has a working interest in the syivan lake project symbo mogi current price reasons to consider mogi price charts confirm oi prices are experiencing the strongest bul market in a generation natura gas prices have tripled in the ast two years with multiple projects in high gear and the expanding production on reserves potentialiy worth muiti millions mogi is seliing for less than the vaiue of its assets montana oi and gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises aiready shares in the oi and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa market in fact four of dow jones ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related but it s in the mid sized explorers and deveiopers like montana oi mogi that the biggest gains are being made in the last months many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns breaking news april montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the w m well the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after the company s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late s and has produced over million barrels mbbls of high quality crude oil and billion cubic feet bcf of associated natural gas predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics the original freehold lease on section w m was leased to a major oil company as was most of the sylvan lake field itself an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in w m in and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting as a consequence the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights below the base of the jurassic formations on the west one half of section back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early s this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically not often by the major companies accordingly these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee through diligent land work including field visits our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional acres one quarter section of section energy has the right to earn of this prospect possibly with the drilling of a test well in w m land discussion our partners have secured a working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section w m the land comprises some acres one section or one square mile equals acres primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows one quarter section spacing acres for oil and one section spacing acres for natural gas the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units called holdings should you be able to prove to the province s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density almost the entire sylvan lake field pekisko pool has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well geological discussion pekisko formation the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper older pekisko formation the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks impermeable layers of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous jurassic impermeable shales these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty five years accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location the capacity of the processing facility is approximately mmcf d with current throughput of only mmcf d accordingly excess capacity of mmcf d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer alberta accordingly trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system for more detailed project description please see news release dated fri apr good luck and successfu trading conclusion the examples above show the awesome earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor s radar screens many of you are already familiar with this is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you then you may feel the time has come to act and please watch this one trade tuesday go mogi penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors this profile is

and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest the company has a working interest in the syivan lake project symbo mogi current price reasons to consider mogi price charts confirm oi prices are experiencing the strongest bul market in a generation natura gas prices have tripled in the ast two years with multiple projects in high gear and the expanding production on reserves potentialiy worth muiti millions mogi is seliing for less than the vaiue of its assets montana oi and gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises aiready shares in the oi and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa market in fact four of dow jones ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related but it s in the mid sized explorers and deveiopers like montana oi mogi that the biggest gains are being made in the last months many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns breaking news april montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the w m well the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after the company s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late s and has produced over million barrels mbbls of high quality crude oil and billion cubic feet bcf of associated natural gas predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics the original freehold lease on section w m was leased to a major oil company as was most of the sylvan lake field itself an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in w m in and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting as a consequence the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights below the base of the jurassic formations on the west one half of section back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early s this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically not often by the major companies accordingly these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee through diligent land work including field visits our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional acres one quarter section of section energy has the right to earn of this prospect possibly with the drilling of a test well in w m land discussion our partners have secured a working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section w m the land comprises some acres one section or one square mile equals acres primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows one quarter section spacing acres for oil and one section spacing acres for natural gas the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units called holdings should you be able to prove to the province s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density almost the entire sylvan lake field pekisko pool has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well geological discussion pekisko formation the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper older pekisko formation the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks impermeable layers of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous jurassic impermeable shales these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty five years accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location the capacity of the processing facility is approximately mmcf d with current throughput of only mmcf d accordingly excess capacity of mmcf d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer alberta accordingly trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system for more detailed project description please see news release dated fri apr good luck and successfu trading conclusion the examples above show the awesome earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor s radar screens many of you are already familiar with this is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you then you may feel the time has come to act and please watch this one trade tuesday go mogi penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors this profile is
