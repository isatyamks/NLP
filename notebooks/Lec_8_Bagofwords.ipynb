      "jump in to gain substantial ground immediately we are very excited about this new upcoming stock about to explode montana oil and gas inc mogi to explore further opportunities in alberta canada is an energy deveioper in canada s most highiy coveted reservoirs aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oi and gas again this morning montana oil and gas inc mogi news announces that the syivan lake oil and gas project is sti awaiting a rig at this time the surface lease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest the company has a working interest in the syivan lake project symbo mogi current price reasons to consider mogi price charts confirm oi prices are experiencing the strongest bul market in a generation natura gas prices have tripled in the ast two years with multiple projects in high gear and the expanding production on reserves potentialiy worth muiti millions mogi is seliing for less than the vaiue of its assets montana oi and gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises aiready shares in the oi and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa market in fact four of dow jones ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related but it s in the mid sized explorers and deveiopers like montana oi mogi that the biggest gains are being made in the last months many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns breaking news april montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the w m well the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after the company s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late s and has produced over million barrels mbbls of high quality crude oil and billion cubic feet bcf of associated natural gas predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics the original freehold lease on section w m was leased to a major oil company as was most of the sylvan lake field itself an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in w m in and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting as a consequence the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights below the base of the jurassic formations on the west one half of section back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early s this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically not often by the major companies accordingly these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee through diligent land work including field visits our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional acres one quarter section of section energy has the right to earn of this prospect possibly with the drilling of a test well in w m land discussion our partners have secured a working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section w m the land comprises some acres one section or one square mile equals acres primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows one quarter section spacing acres for oil and one section spacing acres for natural gas the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units called holdings should you be able to prove to the province s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density almost the entire sylvan lake field pekisko pool has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well geological discussion pekisko formation the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper older pekisko formation the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks impermeable layers of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous jurassic impermeable shales these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty five years accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location the capacity of the processing facility is approximately mmcf d with current throughput of only mmcf d accordingly excess capacity of mmcf d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer alberta accordingly trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system for more detailed project description please see news release dated fri apr good luck and successfu trading conclusion the examples above show the awesome earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor s radar screens many of you are already familiar with this is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you then you may feel the time has come to act and please watch this one trade tuesday go mogi penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors this profile is

      "northern natural gas yesterday enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron s right to repurchase until june we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy while we would like to keep northern natural we still have some miles of safe profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our billion damage claim against dynegy it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services ken dear ets colleague on thursday enron entered into a settlement over dynegy s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy in this respect enron corp has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas consequently enron corp has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved the company has concluded that with this settlement enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court for the northern natural gas employees i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day to day satisfaction of running a valuable successful business beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas over many years we have run high quality cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets keep up the good work stan\n",

john figliolini president of atlantis business development corporation inc otcbb ldgkcpf dear shareholder addlrko i am writing to you today to discuss the new direction which your company will be heading up until this point we made it clear that abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of the market our basic premise was to seek out companies that can be turned into positive cash flow businesses with the proper equity investment made into them by abdv fine wein records is an example of that with a financial commitment of by abdv we expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant positive cash flow over the next months from the various projects they are currently working on e direct is another example we should start to see some meaningful positive cash flow developing and continuing over the next months however abdv has not maintained a particular industry focus as of today that has changed wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir last week we announced that abdv will be providing in equity financing to future quest inc pink sheets a company in the oil gas sector this was the start of our new direction abdv will be dedicated in locating and provide managerial accounting and financing for companies in the energy field from oil and gas companies to alternative energy companies jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft you may ask why the energy related field simply it currently offers many opportunities and with the price of oil approaching per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth to be made in this sector according to adjusted inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak of from the s however unlike the oil crisis of the past we are looking at what will be a problem to stay with us for a long time simply put the demand for oil world wide has increased by some this year alone most of which is because of china the increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the bubble bursts will result in oil back in the level we are looking at a trend that is now cemented in stone there are more players in the world economy today that require oil gas to propel their own economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at these higher levels abdv has already aligned itself with individuals that have experience in the energy field these individuals will help locate viable opportunities and the funding necessary to participate in these opportunities wtxrxayfisoira so what do we do with our non energy related businesses such as fine wein records and e direct well first of all we will continue to incubate and nurture these businesses until they are at a level where they can move on their own i believe that both of these companies will be strong viable businesses in months from now at that point i will recommend to abdv s board of directors that we spin off these two businesses to our shareholders this strategy is in keeping with the basic premise of our business module whereby we share the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing public our portfolio companies we can then continue to concentrate in the energy related field lvxhkmblmcewrw by concentrating on a specific sector such as the energy area we will be able to define abdv s purpose and guide it like a laser our goal will be to locate and make investments in no less than four energy related businesses over the next months i believe that by maintaining

original message from kenneth r pybus to sent wednesday november am fwd gop action plan what you can do i got this from paul sperry at worldnetdaily i don t know who joe morris is but this sounds like a plan note that this has been circulating since last thursday united republican fund of illinois chicago november from joseph a morris president to urf leaders and friends herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the florida recount confirms the election of george bush but al gore fails to concede we all know what is going on in florida and that the election hinges on the outcome i am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what i think is going to happen actually does the recount which will be finished by p m thursday will likely show bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted those ballots will be overwhelmingly for bush a minimum of and probably closer to if the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election this is when something critical happens either gore bows out gracefully or he doesn t and i can almost guarantee he won t these are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming they will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election in when richard nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didn t for the sake of the country expect no such noble behavior this time what will they try one bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the florida results on a flimsy premise they are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in palm beach county i have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least indeed they are identical in form to the punch card ballots used in chicago and cook county illinois in this very election what is more it is just as likely that palm beach county voters who wanted to vote for bush inadvertently voted for nader all parties approved the form of ballot before the election the form of ballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the florida election while i hope this scenario doesn t come to pass i fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country the election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court if this comes to pass the vision of our founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed personally i am not going to stand for this and i hope you won t either the good news is that we are not without voice here is what must be done if the vote count affirms bush s election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the gore camp if they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials at every level with phone calls of outrage that demand gore s concession i mean literally millions of phone calls we must jam their phone banks with calls there are millions of us so it shouldn t be too difficult while you re at it send e mails to your local newspapers as well if it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for gore to withstand the pressure he will have to relent here are some places to start the

diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia south america source company website currently trading at p possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has started and is expected to last all week pp imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so if you had the scoop on the following stock p otcbb mbah this stock closed at on september lst this little giant closed at on october th up in about weeks do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon p as many of you may agree some not all of these stocks move in price because they are promoted making a very large number of investors aware of the stock the awareness is underway on dmxp pp let s look at the company delta mining and exploration corp otc dmxpp about the company p delta mining and exploration corp otc dmxp is a mineral exploration company that controls properties totaling acres approximately sq miles in montana the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states another acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia south america initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america p the management team is led by chief executive officer dr barry rayment who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level dr rayment brings years of experience in the field of geology along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry dr rayment was the president of bema gold corp amex bgo a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars he was also affiliated with glamis gold gold fields mining and amselco exploration bp minerals among others his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward p among the support team is stephen kay a geologist with more than years experience in exploration throughout europe south africa south america and the united states while with gold fields mining corp stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california p delta has experienced significant technical success since its start up in for example delta has discovered the first in situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite southeast of lewistown the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds including pyrope garnet chromite and clinoprroxene p an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta canada p in bolivia delta controls approximately two thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering acres sq miles the other one third is presently being explored by de beers in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified p delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration p in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls they also control a gold property with great potential the property is near la paz in bolivia where initial analysis revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an extensive exploration program pp source company website p recent headlines go online and read the full stories p delta mining and exploration corp is invited to attend a conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce p delta mining and exploration corp visits homestead property in preparation of work program p delta mining and exploration corp discloses preliminary gold exploration findings in south america p delta mining and exploration corp looks to continue diamond exploration in south america pp will dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the stock this weekend

      "new version of stack manager introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade summary of new features multiple children a child product can be the parent of another child multiple links in a chain and different types of links can be placed against a single parent static product bar prices when you change a price in the product bar and hit the or button the price stays it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout sorting you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field for multiple sorts hold down your shift key parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified e g the product bar might before have said basis link parent and now would say stand alone parent detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain for example child product a can be linked to parent product b which is in turn linked to parent product c warning although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain system performance is degraded by large chains this is because when a customer attempts a transaction the database must lock each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks vertical chains multiple parents and children in one long link are much slower to process than flat chains one parent with many children large vertical chains should be avoided related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent for example child product a can have a basis link to parent product b at the same time child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for sticky product bar price and volume changes when you change a number on the product bar it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out this makes it easier to update prices volumes spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the or buttons one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements with the old version of stack manager if the price delta was too small traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth this makes it harder for customers to transact with us each time they try a new price update moves the price resulting in an increased transaction failure rate entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer but larger price movements are necessary improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices a new field for offset to last trade this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu sorting selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old you can now choose any field heading type location reference period etc and sort by that item you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key example if you select type and then location while holding the shift key you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type by location in alphabetical order if you right click on the product menu you can choose from the same sort criteria plus you can select sort by web order which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website note however that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing when you select products you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another parent products and f x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs the new version does not show the type of link this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product some traders may notice that their products which have f x links are now identified with a stylised fx in the product list this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent rather than managed individually assistance as always if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality please contact the hour help desk houston london australia general feedback if you have any comments on the new functionality or suggestions for further functionality please call david forster on if you had previously suggested new functionality which didn t make it into this release rest assured that you have not been forgotten we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of

      "tenaska iv gas daren per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and williams apache and our understanding of the agency agreement i had a few items i wanted to discuss with you in lieu of our meeting today that was cancelled looking at the october gas supply to the plant i think tenaska iv should have been charged at the contract prices with williams apache i e and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan s summary at price of if this volume was charged at the total would have been a difference of looking at the november gas supply to the plant tenaska iv was charged per mmbtu instead of for volumes of at the price the total settlement price was instead of at showing a difference of i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price pg for gas is which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment if delivered at waha this adjustment started in at per mmbtu and increase by per year thereby currently the adjustment factor is at giving us a price of per mmbtu in reviewing the apache gas agreement pg i noticed that the gas price is at waha at katy carthage for per review of the apache invoices it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at other places i e lomak sterling mendell cdp at a price of if enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a margin difference then that is upside to enron however i think the plant should not be charged above the contract price of looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and october i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from williams and apache of mmbtu per day therefore i don t think spot prices are part of the equation here additionally i recall from our meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of per mmbtu excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas delivery points if my scenario above is correct so based upon items above i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price differences showed above therefore i am planning to wire a payment of see breakout below on friday to enron on behalf of tenaska iv texas partners ltd for this activity month plant gas price amount november november adjustment october adjustment nov agency fee sept agency fee total i discussed these issues with mike mazowita rick hill jody pierce before reaching this conclusion should you have any different ideas or thoughts that i am not covering please call me at and we can discuss thanks james\n",

explorers and deveiopers like montana oi mogi that the biggest gains are being made in the last months many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns breaking news april montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the w m well the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after the company s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late s and has produced over million barrels mbbls of high quality crude oil and billion cubic feet bcf of associated natural gas predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics the original freehold lease on section w m was leased to a major oil company as was most of the sylvan lake field itself an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in w m in and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting as a consequence the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights below the base of the jurassic formations on the west one half of section back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early s this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically not often by the major companies accordingly these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee through diligent land work including field visits our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional acres one quarter section of section energy has the right to earn of this prospect possibly with the drilling of a test well in w m land discussion our partners have secured a working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section w m the land comprises some acres one section or one square mile equals acres primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows one quarter section spacing acres for oil and one section spacing acres for natural gas the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units called holdings should you be able to prove to the province s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density almost the entire sylvan lake field pekisko pool has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well geological discussion pekisko formation the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper older pekisko formation the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks impermeable layers of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous jurassic impermeable shales these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty five years accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location the capacity of the processing facility is approximately mmcf d with current throughput of only mmcf d accordingly excess capacity of mmcf d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer alberta accordingly trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system for more detailed project description please see news release dated fri apr good luck and successfu trading conclusion the examples above show the awesome earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor s radar screens many of you are already familiar with this is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you then you may

john figliolini president of atlantis business development corporation inc otcbb ldgkcpf dear shareholder addlrko i am writing to you today to discuss the new direction which your company will be heading up until this point we made it clear that abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of the market our basic premise was to seek out companies that can be turned into positive cash flow businesses with the proper equity investment made into them by abdv fine wein records is an example of that with a financial commitment of by abdv we expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant positive cash flow over the next months from the various projects they are currently working on e direct is another example we should start to see some meaningful positive cash flow developing and continuing over the next months however abdv has not maintained a particular industry focus as of today that has changed wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir last week we announced that abdv will be providing in equity financing to future quest inc pink sheets a company in the oil gas sector this was the start of our new direction abdv will be dedicated in locating and provide managerial accounting and financing for companies in the energy field from oil and gas companies to alternative energy companies jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft you may ask why the energy related field simply it currently offers many opportunities and with the price of oil approaching per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth to be made in this sector according to adjusted inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak of from the s however unlike the oil crisis of the past we are looking at what will be a problem to stay with us for a long time simply put the demand for oil world wide has increased by some this year alone most of which is because of china the increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the bubble bursts will result in oil back in the level we are looking at a trend that is now cemented in stone there are more players in the world economy today that require oil gas to propel their own economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at these higher levels abdv has already aligned itself with individuals that have experience in the energy field these individuals will help locate viable opportunities and the funding necessary to participate in these opportunities wtxrxayfisoira so what do we do with our non energy related businesses such as fine wein records and e direct well first of all we will continue to incubate and nurture these businesses until they are at a level where they can move on their own i believe that both of these companies will be strong viable businesses in months from now at that point i will recommend to abdv s board of directors that we spin off these two businesses to our shareholders this strategy is in keeping with the basic premise of our business module whereby we share the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing public our portfolio companies we can then continue to concentrate in the energy related field lvxhkmblmcewrw by concentrating on a specific sector such as the energy area we will be able to define abdv s purpose and guide it like a laser our goal will be to locate and make investments in no less than four energy related businesses over the next months i believe that by maintaining

       " 'fw gop action plan what you can do original message from alex fagen mailto alex fagens net sent wednesday november pm to undisclosed recipient rad stup com fw gop action plan what you can do original message from kenneth r pybus to sent wednesday november am fwd gop action plan what you can do i got this from paul sperry at worldnetdaily i don t know who joe morris is but this sounds like a plan note that this has been circulating since last thursday united republican fund of illinois chicago november from joseph a morris president to urf leaders and friends herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the florida recount confirms the election of george bush but al gore fails to concede we all know what is going on in florida and that the election hinges on the outcome i am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what i think is going to happen actually does the recount which will be finished by p m thursday will likely show bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted those ballots will be overwhelmingly for bush a minimum of and probably closer to if the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election this is when something critical happens either gore bows out gracefully or he doesn t and i can almost guarantee he won t these are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming they will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election in when richard nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didn t for the sake of the country expect no such noble behavior this time what will they try one bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the florida results on a flimsy premise they are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in palm beach county i have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least indeed they are identical in form to the punch card ballots used in chicago and cook county illinois in this very election what is more it is just as likely that palm beach county voters who wanted to vote for bush inadvertently voted for nader all parties approved the form of ballot before the election the form of ballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the florida election while i hope this scenario doesn t come to pass i fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country the election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court if this comes to pass the vision of our founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed personally i am not going to stand for this and i hope you won t either the good news is that we are not without voice here is what must be done if the vote count affirms bush s election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the gore camp if they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials at every level with phone calls of outrage that demand gore s concession i mean literally millions of phone calls we must jam their phone banks with calls there are millions of us so it shouldn t be too difficult while you re at it send e mails to your local newspapers as well if it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for gore to withstand the pressure he will have to relent here are some places to start the white house telephone fax e mail president whitehouse gov the vice president s office telephone fax e mail vice president whitehouse gov vice president s senate office telephone senator tom daschle

little giant closed at on october th up in about weeks do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon p as many of you may agree some not all of these stocks move in price because they are promoted making a very large number of investors aware of the stock the awareness is underway on dmxp pp let s look at the company delta mining and exploration corp otc dmxpp about the company p delta mining and exploration corp otc dmxp is a mineral exploration company that controls properties totaling acres approximately sq miles in montana the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states another acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia south america initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america p the management team is led by chief executive officer dr barry rayment who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level dr rayment brings years of experience in the field of geology along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry dr rayment was the president of bema gold corp amex bgo a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars he was also affiliated with glamis gold gold fields mining and amselco exploration bp minerals among others his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward p among the support team is stephen kay a geologist with more than years experience in exploration throughout europe south africa south america and the united states while with gold fields mining corp stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california p delta has experienced significant technical success since its start up in for example delta has discovered the first in situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite southeast of lewistown the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds including pyrope garnet chromite and clinoprroxene p an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta canada p in bolivia delta controls approximately two thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering acres sq miles the other one third is presently being explored by de beers in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified p delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration p in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls they also control a gold property with great potential the property is near la paz in bolivia where initial analysis revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an extensive exploration program pp source company website p recent headlines go online and read the full stories p delta mining and exploration corp is invited to attend a conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce p delta mining and exploration corp visits homestead property in preparation of work program p delta mining and exploration corp discloses preliminary gold exploration findings in

       " 'new version of stack manager introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade summary of new features multiple children a child product can be the parent of another child multiple links in a chain and different types of links can be placed against a single parent static product bar prices when you change a price in the product bar and hit the or button the price stays it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout sorting you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field for multiple sorts hold down your shift key parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified e g the product bar might before have said basis link parent and now would say stand alone parent detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain for example child product a can be linked to parent product b which is in turn linked to parent product c warning although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain system performance is degraded by large chains this is because when a customer attempts a transaction the database must lock each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks vertical chains multiple parents and children in one long link are much slower to process than flat chains one parent with many children large vertical chains should be avoided related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent for example child product a can have a basis link to parent product b at the same time child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for sticky product bar price and volume changes when you change a number on the product bar it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out this makes it easier to update prices volumes spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the or buttons one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements with the old version of stack manager if the price delta was too small traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth this makes it harder for customers to transact with us each time they try a new price update moves the price resulting in an increased transaction failure rate entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer but larger price movements are necessary improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices a new field for offset to last trade this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu sorting selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old you can now choose any field heading type location reference period etc and sort by that item you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key example if you select type and then location while holding the shift key you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type by location in alphabetical order if you right click on the product menu you can choose from the same sort criteria plus you can select sort by web order which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website note however that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing when you select products you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another parent products and f x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs the new version does not show the type of link this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product some traders may notice that their products which have f x links are now identified with a stylised fx in the product list this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent rather than managed individually assistance as always if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality please contact the hour help desk houston london australia general feedback if you have any comments on the new functionality or suggestions for further functionality please call david forster on if you had previously suggested new functionality which didn t make it into this release rest assured that you have not been forgotten we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of
