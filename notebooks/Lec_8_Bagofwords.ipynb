      "jump in to gain substantial ground immediately we are very excited about this new upcoming stock about to explode montana oil and gas inc mogi to explore further opportunities in alberta canada is an energy deveioper in canada s most highiy coveted reservoirs aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oi and gas again this morning montana oil and gas inc mogi news announces that the syivan lake oil and gas project is sti awaiting a rig at this time the surface lease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest the company has a working interest in the syivan lake project symbo mogi current price reasons to consider mogi price charts confirm oi prices are experiencing the strongest bul market in a generation natura gas prices have tripled in the ast two years with multiple projects in high gear and the expanding production on reserves potentialiy worth muiti millions mogi is seliing for less than the vaiue of its assets montana oi and gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises aiready shares in the oi and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa market in fact four of dow jones ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related but it s in the mid sized explorers and deveiopers like montana oi mogi that the biggest gains are being made in the last months many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns breaking news april montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the w m well the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after the company s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late s and has produced over million barrels mbbls of high quality crude oil and billion cubic feet bcf of associated natural gas predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics the original freehold lease on section w m was leased to a major oil company as was most of the sylvan lake field itself an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in w m in and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting as a consequence the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights below the base of the jurassic formations on the west one half of section back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early s this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically not often by the major companies accordingly these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee through diligent land work including field visits our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional acres one quarter section of section energy has the right to earn of this prospect possibly with the drilling of a test well in w m land discussion our partners have secured a working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section w m the land comprises some acres one section or one square mile equals acres primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows one quarter section spacing acres for oil and one section spacing acres for natural gas the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units called holdings should you be able to prove to the province s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density almost the entire sylvan lake field pekisko pool has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well geological discussion pekisko formation the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper older pekisko formation the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks impermeable layers of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous jurassic impermeable shales these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty five years accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location the capacity of the processing facility is approximately mmcf d with current throughput of only mmcf d accordingly excess capacity of mmcf d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer alberta accordingly trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system for more detailed project description please see news release dated fri apr good luck and successfu trading conclusion the examples above show the awesome earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor s radar screens many of you are already familiar with this is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you then you may

      "northern natural gas yesterday enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron s right to repurchase until june we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy while we would like to keep northern natural we still have some miles of safe profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our billion damage claim against dynegy it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services ken dear ets colleague on thursday enron entered into a settlement over dynegy s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy in this respect enron corp has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas consequently enron corp has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved the company has concluded that with this settlement enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court for the northern natural gas employees i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day to day satisfaction of running a valuable successful business beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas over many years we have run high quality cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets keep up the good work stan\n",

john figliolini president of atlantis business development corporation inc otcbb ldgkcpf dear shareholder addlrko i am writing to you today to discuss the new direction which your company will be heading up until this point we made it clear that abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of the market our basic premise was to seek out companies that can be turned into positive cash flow businesses with the proper equity investment made into them by abdv fine wein records is an example of that with a financial commitment of by abdv we expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant positive cash flow over the next months from the various projects they are currently working on e direct is another example we should start to see some meaningful positive cash flow developing and continuing over the next months however abdv has not maintained a particular industry focus as of today that has changed wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir last week we announced that abdv will be providing in equity financing to future quest inc pink sheets a company in the oil gas sector this was the start of our new direction abdv will be dedicated in locating and provide managerial accounting and financing for companies in the energy field from oil and gas companies to alternative energy companies jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft you may ask why the energy related field simply it currently offers many opportunities and with the price of oil approaching per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth to be made in this sector according to adjusted inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak of from the s however unlike the oil crisis of the past we are looking at what will be a problem to stay with us for a long time simply put the demand for oil world wide has increased by some this year alone most of which is because of china the increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the bubble bursts will result in oil back in the level we are looking at a trend that is now cemented in stone there are more players in the world economy today that require oil gas to propel their own economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at these higher levels abdv has already aligned itself with individuals that have experience in the energy field these individuals will help locate viable opportunities and the funding necessary to participate in these opportunities wtxrxayfisoira so what do we do with our non energy related businesses such as fine wein records and e direct well first of all we will continue to incubate and nurture these businesses until they are at a level where they can move on their own i believe that both of these companies will be strong viable businesses in months from now at that point i will recommend to abdv s board of directors that we spin off these two businesses to our shareholders this strategy is in keeping with the basic premise of our business module whereby we share the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing public our portfolio companies we can then continue to concentrate in the energy related field lvxhkmblmcewrw by concentrating on a specific sector such as the energy area we will be able to define abdv s purpose and guide it like a laser our goal will be to locate and make investments in no less than four energy related businesses over the next months i believe that by maintaining

original message from kenneth r pybus to sent wednesday november am fwd gop action plan what you can do i got this from paul sperry at worldnetdaily i don t know who joe morris is but this sounds like a plan note that this has been circulating since last thursday united republican fund of illinois chicago november from joseph a morris president to urf leaders and friends herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the florida recount confirms the election of george bush but al gore fails to concede we all know what is going on in florida and that the election hinges on the outcome i am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what i think is going to happen actually does the recount which will be finished by p m thursday will likely show bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted those ballots will be overwhelmingly for bush a minimum of and probably closer to if the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election this is when something critical happens either gore bows out gracefully or he doesn t and i can almost guarantee he won t these are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming they will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election in when richard nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didn t for the sake of the country expect no such noble behavior this time what will they try one bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the florida results on a flimsy premise they are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in palm beach county i have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least indeed they are identical in form to the punch card ballots used in chicago and cook county illinois in this very election what is more it is just as likely that palm beach county voters who wanted to vote for bush inadvertently voted for nader all parties approved the form of ballot before the election the form of ballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the florida election while i hope this scenario doesn t come to pass i fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country the election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court if this comes to pass the vision of our founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed personally i am not going to stand for this and i hope you won t either the good news is that we are not without voice here is what must be done if the vote count affirms bush s election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the gore camp if they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials at every level with phone calls of outrage that demand gore s concession i mean literally millions of phone calls we must jam their phone banks with calls there are millions of us so it shouldn t be too difficult while you re at it send e mails to your local newspapers as well if it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for gore to withstand the pressure he will have to relent here are some places to start the

diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia south america source company website currently trading at p possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has started and is expected to last all week pp imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so if you had the scoop on the following stock p otcbb mbah this stock closed at on september lst this little giant closed at on october th up in about weeks do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon p as many of you may agree some not all of these stocks move in price because they are promoted making a very large number of investors aware of the stock the awareness is underway on dmxp pp let s look at the company delta mining and exploration corp otc dmxpp about the company p delta mining and exploration corp otc dmxp is a mineral exploration company that controls properties totaling acres approximately sq miles in montana the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states another acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia south america initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america p the management team is led by chief executive officer dr barry rayment who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level dr rayment brings years of experience in the field of geology along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry dr rayment was the president of bema gold corp amex bgo a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars he was also affiliated with glamis gold gold fields mining and amselco exploration bp minerals among others his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward p among the support team is stephen kay a geologist with more than years experience in exploration throughout europe south africa south america and the united states while with gold fields mining corp stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california p delta has experienced significant technical success since its start up in for example delta has discovered the first in situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite southeast of lewistown the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds including pyrope garnet chromite and clinoprroxene p an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta canada p in bolivia delta controls approximately two thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering acres sq miles the other one third is presently being explored by de beers in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified p delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration p in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls they also control a gold property with great potential the property is near la paz in bolivia where initial analysis revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an extensive exploration program pp source company website p recent headlines go online and read the full stories p delta mining and exploration corp is invited to attend a conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce p delta mining and exploration corp visits homestead property in preparation of work program p delta mining and exploration corp discloses preliminary gold exploration findings in south america p delta mining and exploration corp looks to continue diamond exploration in south america pp will dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the stock this weekend

      "new version of stack manager introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade summary of new features multiple children a child product can be the parent of another child multiple links in a chain and different types of links can be placed against a single parent static product bar prices when you change a price in the product bar and hit the or button the price stays it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout sorting you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field for multiple sorts hold down your shift key parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified e g the product bar might before have said basis link parent and now would say stand alone parent detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain for example child product a can be linked to parent product b which is in turn linked to parent product c warning although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain system performance is degraded by large chains this is because when a customer attempts a transaction the database must lock each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks vertical chains multiple parents and children in one long link are much slower to process than flat chains one parent with many children large vertical chains should be avoided related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent for example child product a can have a basis link to parent product b at the same time child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for sticky product bar price and volume changes when you change a number on the product bar it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out this makes it easier to update prices volumes spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the or buttons one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements with the old version of stack manager if the price delta was too small traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth this makes it harder for customers to transact with us each time they try a new price update moves the price resulting in an increased transaction failure rate entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer but larger price movements are necessary improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices a new field for offset to last trade this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu sorting selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old you can now choose any field heading type location reference period etc and sort by that item you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key example if you select type and then location while holding the shift key you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type by location in alphabetical order if you right click on the product menu you can choose from the same sort criteria plus you can select sort by web order which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website note however that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing when you select products you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another parent products and f x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs the new version does not show the type of link this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product some traders may notice that their products which have f x links are now identified with a stylised fx in the product list this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent rather than managed individually assistance as always if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality please contact the hour help desk houston london australia general feedback if you have any comments on the new functionality or suggestions for further functionality please call david forster on if you had previously suggested new functionality which didn t make it into this release rest assured that you have not been forgotten we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of

      "tenaska iv gas daren per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and williams apache and our understanding of the agency agreement i had a few items i wanted to discuss with you in lieu of our meeting today that was cancelled looking at the october gas supply to the plant i think tenaska iv should have been charged at the contract prices with williams apache i e and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan s summary at price of if this volume was charged at the total would have been a difference of looking at the november gas supply to the plant tenaska iv was charged per mmbtu instead of for volumes of at the price the total settlement price was instead of at showing a difference of i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price pg for gas is which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment if delivered at waha this adjustment started in at per mmbtu and increase by per year thereby currently the adjustment factor is at giving us a price of per mmbtu in reviewing the apache gas agreement pg i noticed that the gas price is at waha at katy carthage for per review of the apache invoices it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at other places i e lomak sterling mendell cdp at a price of if enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a margin difference then that is upside to enron however i think the plant should not be charged above the contract price of looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and october i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from williams and apache of mmbtu per day therefore i don t think spot prices are part of the equation here additionally i recall from our meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of per mmbtu excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas delivery points if my scenario above is correct so based upon items above i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price differences showed above therefore i am planning to wire a payment of see breakout below on friday to enron on behalf of tenaska iv texas partners ltd for this activity month plant gas price amount november november adjustment october adjustment nov agency fee sept agency fee total i discussed these issues with mike mazowita rick hill jody pierce before reaching this conclusion should you have any different ideas or thoughts that i am not covering please call me at and we can discuss thanks james\n",

      "organizational changes we are making a number of significant organizational changes these changes are intended to accomplish four key objectives first we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built around a relatively small strategic asset position second we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting relationships particularly with joe sutton s departure the ability to directly manage the day to day activities of independent business units has become increasingly difficult third we need to accomplish these changes without in any way compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower yielding asset positions and fourth as always we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities enron wholesale services today we are forming enron wholesale services ews which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following enhanced communication and coordination across business units more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business and more rapid extension of enron s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets enron wholesale services will include our current north american european including japan and australia global markets and industrial markets operations and will be expanded to include enron s net works business unit as well as a new unit enron global assets in addition enron s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below mark frevert currently chairman of each of our wholesale units will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services greg whalley currently chairman and ceo of enron net works will join mark in the office of

serve as ceo of enron south america throughout the transition jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services following the transition jim will join ees

weather insurance equities interest rates foreign exchange and agricultural products enron industrial markets enron industrial markets organization under the leadership of jeff mcmahon president ceo and ray bowen chief operating officer remains unchanged commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with and be managed by the individual business units we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units these newly defined roles are as follows mid and back office operations sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews these services will become part of enron net works with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey executive vice president and chief

could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place one problem may be with the imbalance data sets which are not in production yet edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities especially where nominations were sent for entire month can t remember the rules on this one but i think unify does have some safe guards idiot proofs to force re pathing unify does have the ability to over ride duns numbers yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response what are if any impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place prior periods re pathing i have a call into

ability for you to invalidate the deal and then change the counterparty however i did add a warning message warning changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes make sure pipeline allows this change some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback i assume for the same reasons we had this rule it used to blow up our old scheduling systems pre unify some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal before you make the change make sure the logistics person is aware just in case it causes problems with their pipeline sorry i don t know which pipes these are you will have to ask the unify team there is one rule still in place you can change from ena im east to ena im market east but not from ena im texas to hplc im hplc when changing business units they must be the same legal entity warning not the same legal entity also beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals transport capacity storage cash out once the deal is invalidated there are no rules don t forget the items were locked down for a reason if you invalidate a service deal and change the previously locked down data that was validated and someone used these deals in unify it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted always check with someone from unify to make sure no one

      "california energy crisis california s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues what happened in california the source of california s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand california s economy grew percent since this increased the demand for electricity by percent at the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added the result predictably is a shortage this summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state in addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis first the state s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility in california state regulation prevented this strategy this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price second retail markets were not deregulated regulated retail rates remained in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate they are now nearly bankrupt in short california s problems were caused by regulation not deregulation regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices at the time california was developing its restructuring plan enron warned the state s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives which if adopted would have averted the current crisis enron s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem power sellers including enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media here are the facts other than a small amount of wind power enron is not a generator in the state of california every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers as a seller to end use markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face we protected and still protect our customers from price volatility you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market early reports mischaracterized this as a enron continues to sign up customers in the state and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets enron s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs there has never been more demand for our products and services the solution the solution to california s crisis is also straightforward in summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state s utilities increasing supply california s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year in california it often takes to years california simply must streamline this process ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much nox california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is an open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today california should fully open its retail market reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixed price basis the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk restoring the financial integrity of the state s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills this has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse price caps have been proposed they don t work have never worked and they will not work here price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california there is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education roads and other public goods which the private sector cannot do as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media it s important for you to know this we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state\n",

used in gas production in lets say a year or so would this help performance this would also force the schedulers to path think about the way they are pathing their transactions and not rely on old paths that may no longer be accurate we ve seen old bad zero paths be re used accidentally on the scheduling position window is the weakest link goodbye on contract reference i know is used alot in the supply and market list nomlogic is also slated to use these contract reference fields for comments do we need it in the inventory list probably not as much as the supply and market list but i still believe it s necessary for pools and imbalance accounts on we use this functionality alot on cgas tenn trco and sab when we path one to many or many to one in chunks it does seem to go faster than one path at a time on brokered paths could really just be slammed in there no need for the extra processing that occurs for service contracts thanks original message from sullivan patti sent

rewrite optimization project following are my comments the managers cc d might have some additional thoughts original message from pena matt sent monday october pm to pinion richard jaquet tammy superty robert pena matt cc warner john ripley brian d souza romeo rao ramesh path manager rewrite optimization project importance high all we re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed going foward i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers schedulers we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely who ever you choose we would need about of their time for now later on with coordination efforts and testing it may go up to i don t see that happening for a while though the sooner we get someone to devote to this the better off we will be i expect these changes that we ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit that being said we ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager currently the path manager attempts to reuse path ids i can t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn t find a match i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can t think of a valid reason for performing this work i talked with dave nommensen and according to him what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place from a scheduling perspective my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it if you were overpathed you d see it in the path manager either way pinion richard to restate the question for clarity in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply market and a service adds any up downstream contract information and or duns or drn override and then saves it unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted has this changed at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path activity number match for nominations texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected therefore if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify i don t think that this constant old path look up is needed kinsey lisa get rid of this the scheduling position window does anyone use this if not we ll remove the code logic that populates this window i have never seen a scheduler use this please verify pinion richard originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system autonoms so it was duplicated in unify by request it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it s use the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers lose it kinsey lisa why is this still here on the inventory pool list does anyone need to see the contarct references list again this code is called every retrieval time and doesn t appear to be used from my observations if they do need this information we could provide it but if not i d prefer to remove the functionality pinion richard this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool keep it kinsey lisa yes we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths what s the average number of paths they create at one time what about updates i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts by update i mean going to the path list and changing an upstream downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created pinion richard this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline there is no average they typically update a path with up downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however i hope this answers your question i see no change to this process at this time kinsey lisa on some pipes this function is used more than others when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible at this time i do not see a need to change this process on brokered paths do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service in other words when updating brokered arrangements we don t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated why do we do this for service is it because we have to renominate it i assume that s what it s for since we don t send brokered paths to the pipe anyway with the nomlogic implmentation two way interface we were planning on having it behave the same way as service we need this verified pinion richard we don t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path i don t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time kinsey lisa agree with richard\n",

back impact to logistics unify if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place one problem may be with the imbalance data sets which are not in production yet edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities especially where nominations were sent for entire month can t remember the rules on this one but i think unify does have some safe guards idiot proofs to force re pathing unify does have the ability to over ride duns numbers yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response what are

add a warning message warning changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes make sure pipeline allows this change some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback i assume for the same reasons we had this rule it used to blow up our old scheduling systems pre unify some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal before you make the change make sure the logistics person is aware just in case it causes problems with their pipeline sorry i don t know which pipes these are you will have to ask the unify team there is one rule still in place you can change from ena im east to ena im market east but not from ena im texas to hplc im hplc when changing business units they must be the same legal entity warning not the same legal entity also beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals transport capacity storage cash out once the deal is invalidated there are no rules don t forget the items were locked down for a reason if you invalidate a service deal and change the previously locked down data that was validated and someone used these deals in unify it is highly likely that the unify deals

romeo rao ramesh kinsey lisa lamadrid victor sullivan mary sullivan patti heal kevin staab theresa farmer daren j jaquet tammy superty robert bussell l kathryn re path manager rewrite optimization project following are my comments the managers cc d might have some additional thoughts original message from pena matt sent monday october pm to pinion richard jaquet tammy superty robert pena matt cc warner john ripley brian d souza romeo rao ramesh path manager rewrite optimization project importance high all we re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed going foward i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers schedulers we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely who ever you choose we would need about of their time for now later on with coordination efforts and testing it may go up to i don t see that happening for a while though the sooner we get someone to devote to this the better off we will be i expect these changes that we ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit that being said we ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager currently the path manager attempts to reuse path ids i can t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn t find a match i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can t think of a valid reason for performing this work i talked with dave nommensen and according to him what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place from a scheduling perspective my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it if you were overpathed you d see it in the path manager either way pinion richard to restate the question for clarity in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply market and a service adds any up downstream contract information and or duns or drn override and then saves it unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted has this changed at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path activity number match for nominations texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected therefore if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify i don t think that this constant old path look up is needed kinsey lisa get rid of this the scheduling position window does anyone use this if not we ll remove the code logic that populates this window i have never seen a scheduler use this please verify pinion richard originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system autonoms so it was duplicated in unify by request it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it s use the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers lose it kinsey lisa why is this still here on the inventory pool list does anyone need to see the contarct references list again this code is called every retrieval time and doesn t appear to be used from my observations if they do need this information we could provide it but if not i d prefer to remove the functionality pinion richard this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool keep it kinsey lisa yes we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths what s the average number of paths they create at one time what about updates i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts by update i mean going to the path list and changing an upstream downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created pinion richard this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline there is no average they typically update a path with up downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however i hope this answers your question i see no change to this process at this time kinsey lisa on some pipes this function is used more than others when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible at this time i do not see a need to change this process on brokered paths do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service in other words when updating brokered arrangements we don t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated why do we do this for service is it because we have to renominate it i assume that s what it s for since we don t send brokered paths to the pipe anyway with the nomlogic implmentation two way interface we were planning on having it behave the same way as service we need this verified pinion richard we don t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path i don t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time kinsey lisa agree with richard\n",

explorers and deveiopers like montana oi mogi that the biggest gains are being made in the last months many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns breaking news april montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the w m well the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after the company s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late s and has produced over million barrels mbbls of high quality crude oil and billion cubic feet bcf of associated natural gas predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics the original freehold lease on section w m was leased to a major oil company as was most of the sylvan lake field itself an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in w m in and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting as a consequence the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights below the base of the jurassic formations on the west one half of section back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early s this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically not often by the major companies accordingly these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee through diligent land work including field visits our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional acres one quarter section of section energy has the right to earn of this prospect possibly with the drilling of a test well in w m land discussion our partners have secured a working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section w m the land comprises some acres one section or one square mile equals acres primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows one quarter section spacing acres for oil and one section spacing acres for natural gas the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units called holdings should you be able to prove to the province s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density almost the entire sylvan lake field pekisko pool has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well geological discussion pekisko formation the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper older pekisko formation the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks impermeable layers of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous jurassic impermeable shales these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty five years accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location the capacity of the processing facility is approximately mmcf d with current throughput of only mmcf d accordingly excess capacity of mmcf d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer alberta accordingly trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system for more detailed project description please see news release dated fri apr good luck and successfu trading conclusion the examples above show the awesome earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor s radar screens many of you are already familiar with this is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you then you may

john figliolini president of atlantis business development corporation inc otcbb ldgkcpf dear shareholder addlrko i am writing to you today to discuss the new direction which your company will be heading up until this point we made it clear that abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of the market our basic premise was to seek out companies that can be turned into positive cash flow businesses with the proper equity investment made into them by abdv fine wein records is an example of that with a financial commitment of by abdv we expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant positive cash flow over the next months from the various projects they are currently working on e direct is another example we should start to see some meaningful positive cash flow developing and continuing over the next months however abdv has not maintained a particular industry focus as of today that has changed wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir last week we announced that abdv will be providing in equity financing to future quest inc pink sheets a company in the oil gas sector this was the start of our new direction abdv will be dedicated in locating and provide managerial accounting and financing for companies in the energy field from oil and gas companies to alternative energy companies jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft you may ask why the energy related field simply it currently offers many opportunities and with the price of oil approaching per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth to be made in this sector according to adjusted inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak of from the s however unlike the oil crisis of the past we are looking at what will be a problem to stay with us for a long time simply put the demand for oil world wide has increased by some this year alone most of which is because of china the increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the bubble bursts will result in oil back in the level we are looking at a trend that is now cemented in stone there are more players in the world economy today that require oil gas to propel their own economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at these higher levels abdv has already aligned itself with individuals that have experience in the energy field these individuals will help locate viable opportunities and the funding necessary to participate in these opportunities wtxrxayfisoira so what do we do with our non energy related businesses such as fine wein records and e direct well first of all we will continue to incubate and nurture these businesses until they are at a level where they can move on their own i believe that both of these companies will be strong viable businesses in months from now at that point i will recommend to abdv s board of directors that we spin off these two businesses to our shareholders this strategy is in keeping with the basic premise of our business module whereby we share the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing public our portfolio companies we can then continue to concentrate in the energy related field lvxhkmblmcewrw by concentrating on a specific sector such as the energy area we will be able to define abdv s purpose and guide it like a laser our goal will be to locate and make investments in no less than four energy related businesses over the next months i believe that by maintaining

       " 'fw gop action plan what you can do original message from alex fagen mailto alex fagens net sent wednesday november pm to undisclosed recipient rad stup com fw gop action plan what you can do original message from kenneth r pybus to sent wednesday november am fwd gop action plan what you can do i got this from paul sperry at worldnetdaily i don t know who joe morris is but this sounds like a plan note that this has been circulating since last thursday united republican fund of illinois chicago november from joseph a morris president to urf leaders and friends herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the florida recount confirms the election of george bush but al gore fails to concede we all know what is going on in florida and that the election hinges on the outcome i am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what i think is going to happen actually does the recount which will be finished by p m thursday will likely show bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted those ballots will be overwhelmingly for bush a minimum of and probably closer to if the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election this is when something critical happens either gore bows out gracefully or he doesn t and i can almost guarantee he won t these are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming they will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election in when richard nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didn t for the sake of the country expect no such noble behavior this time what will they try one bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the florida results on a flimsy premise they are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in palm beach county i have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least indeed they are identical in form to the punch card ballots used in chicago and cook county illinois in this very election what is more it is just as likely that palm beach county voters who wanted to vote for bush inadvertently voted for nader all parties approved the form of ballot before the election the form of ballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the florida election while i hope this scenario doesn t come to pass i fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country the election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court if this comes to pass the vision of our founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed personally i am not going to stand for this and i hope you won t either the good news is that we are not without voice here is what must be done if the vote count affirms bush s election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the gore camp if they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials at every level with phone calls of outrage that demand gore s concession i mean literally millions of phone calls we must jam their phone banks with calls there are millions of us so it shouldn t be too difficult while you re at it send e mails to your local newspapers as well if it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for gore to withstand the pressure he will have to relent here are some places to start the white house telephone fax e mail president whitehouse gov the vice president s office telephone fax e mail vice president whitehouse gov vice president s senate office telephone senator tom daschle

little giant closed at on october th up in about weeks do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon p as many of you may agree some not all of these stocks move in price because they are promoted making a very large number of investors aware of the stock the awareness is underway on dmxp pp let s look at the company delta mining and exploration corp otc dmxpp about the company p delta mining and exploration corp otc dmxp is a mineral exploration company that controls properties totaling acres approximately sq miles in montana the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states another acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia south america initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america p the management team is led by chief executive officer dr barry rayment who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level dr rayment brings years of experience in the field of geology along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry dr rayment was the president of bema gold corp amex bgo a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars he was also affiliated with glamis gold gold fields mining and amselco exploration bp minerals among others his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward p among the support team is stephen kay a geologist with more than years experience in exploration throughout europe south africa south america and the united states while with gold fields mining corp stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california p delta has experienced significant technical success since its start up in for example delta has discovered the first in situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite southeast of lewistown the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds including pyrope garnet chromite and clinoprroxene p an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta canada p in bolivia delta controls approximately two thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering acres sq miles the other one third is presently being explored by de beers in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified p delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration p in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls they also control a gold property with great potential the property is near la paz in bolivia where initial analysis revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an extensive exploration program pp source company website p recent headlines go online and read the full stories p delta mining and exploration corp is invited to attend a conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce p delta mining and exploration corp visits homestead property in preparation of work program p delta mining and exploration corp discloses preliminary gold exploration findings in

       " 'new version of stack manager introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade summary of new features multiple children a child product can be the parent of another child multiple links in a chain and different types of links can be placed against a single parent static product bar prices when you change a price in the product bar and hit the or button the price stays it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout sorting you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field for multiple sorts hold down your shift key parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified e g the product bar might before have said basis link parent and now would say stand alone parent detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain for example child product a can be linked to parent product b which is in turn linked to parent product c warning although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain system performance is degraded by large chains this is because when a customer attempts a transaction the database must lock each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks vertical chains multiple parents and children in one long link are much slower to process than flat chains one parent with many children large vertical chains should be avoided related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent for example child product a can have a basis link to parent product b at the same time child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for sticky product bar price and volume changes when you change a number on the product bar it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out this makes it easier to update prices volumes spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the or buttons one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements with the old version of stack manager if the price delta was too small traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth this makes it harder for customers to transact with us each time they try a new price update moves the price resulting in an increased transaction failure rate entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer but larger price movements are necessary improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices a new field for offset to last trade this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu sorting selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old you can now choose any field heading type location reference period etc and sort by that item you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key example if you select type and then location while holding the shift key you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type by location in alphabetical order if you right click on the product menu you can choose from the same sort criteria plus you can select sort by web order which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website note however that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing when you select products you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another parent products and f x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs the new version does not show the type of link this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product some traders may notice that their products which have f x links are now identified with a stylised fx in the product list this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent rather than managed individually assistance as always if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality please contact the hour help desk houston london australia general feedback if you have any comments on the new functionality or suggestions for further functionality please call david forster on if you had previously suggested new functionality which didn t make it into this release rest assured that you have not been forgotten we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of
